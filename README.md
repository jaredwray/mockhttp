A simple HTTP server that can be used to mock HTTP responses for testing purposes. Inspired by [httpbin](https://httpbin.org/) and built using `nodejs` and `fastify` with the idea of running it via https://mockhttp.org, via docker `jaredwray/mockhttp`, or nodejs `npm install jaredwray/mockhttp`.

# Deploy via Docker
```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 jaredwray/mockhttp
```

# Deploy via NodeJS
```bash
npm install @jaredwray/mockhttp --save
```

then run `mockhttp` in your code.

```javascript
import { mockhttp } from '@jaredwray/mockhttp';
mockhttp.start(); // start the server
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/ip');
mockhttp.stop(); // stop the server
```
