A simple HTTP server that can be used to mock HTTP responses for testing purposes. Inspired by [httpbin](https://httpbin.org/) and built using `nodejs` and `fastify` with the idea of running it via https://mockhttp.org, via docker `jaredwray/mockhttp`, or nodejs `npm install jaredwray/mockhttp`.

# Features
* All the features of [httpbin](https://httpbin.org/)
* `@fastify/helmet` built in by default
* Built with `nodejs`, `typescript`, and `fastify`
* Deploy via `docker` or `nodejs`
* Global deployment via [mockhttp.org](https://mockhttp.org) (free service)
* Better API documentation and examples
* Auto detect the port that is not in use
* Maintained and updated regularly!

# Deploy via Docker
```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 jaredwray/mockhttp
```

# Deploy via Docker Compose
```yaml
services:
  mockhttp:
    image: jaredwray/mockhttp:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```

If you want to run it on a different port, just change the `3000` to whatever port you want and add in the environment variable `PORT` to the environment.

```yaml
services:
  mockhttp:
    image: jaredwray/mockhttp:latest
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    environment:
      - PORT=3001
```

You can see an example of this in the [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) file.

# Deploy via NodeJS
```bash
npm install @jaredwray/mockhttp --save
```

then run `mockhttp` in your code.

```javascript
import { mockhttp } from '@jaredwray/mockhttp';
await mockhttp.start(); // start the server
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/get');
console.log(reaponse);
await mockhttp.stop(); // stop the server
```
